🩸 WHAT’S LEFT
**(this is the demo text only game!!! a version with ilustration is on the making)***

A post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror text adventure

A decade ago, something fell from the sky.
There was no warning. No invasion. No mercy.

In a single blink, the world ended.

Cities burned. The air changed.
And not everything that survived is still human.

You are one of the last survivors, wandering through the ruins of civilization —
searching for answers, supplies…
and the terrifying truth of what’s left of us.

☢️ THE WORLD

The wasteland is not empty.

Something watches.
Something learns.
Some things pretend.

Alien metamorphs stalk the land:

They don’t always look alien.

Sometimes…
they look familiar.

🧠 SURVIVAL SYSTEM

Every choice matters. Every mistake costs.

Use your skills to stay alive:

Stealth – Move unseen through the wasteland

Perception – Notice details you shouldn’t miss… or things you were never meant to see

Scavenging – Find what you need before someone else does

Lockpicking – Take what doesn’t belong to you

Intelligence – Understand alien tech and learn faster

Stamina – Endure injuries, exhaustion, and fear

Luck – The difference between survival… and sudden death

Charisma – Talk your way out of situations where bullets won’t help

🗡️ COMBAT & HORROR

Turn-based combat

Skill checks that can save or doom you

Enemies that adapt, ambush, and retaliate

Sometimes, running away is the only sane choice

Not every threat should be fought.

🎒 INVENTORY & EQUIPMENT

Loot, notes, keys, ammo, medical supplies

Equip unique items like:

Cowboy Hat – Luck and survival bonuses

Alien Scientist Suit – Protection against the unknown

Read notes left behind by those who didn’t make it

Their last words may keep you alive.

💾 CONTROLS

I – Open Inventory

S – Save Game (also on level up)

L – Load Game

Simple to play.
Hard to survive.

🧪 STATUS

🚧 Work in Progress
New areas, enemies, equipment, and story elements are actively being added.

🧬 FINAL WARNING

The wasteland remembers.
It watches you learn.

And it changes.

Don’t trust what you see.
Don’t sleep.

Welcome to What’s Left.
